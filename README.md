# Make your first Kaggle submission!

## Can we predict who would've survived the Titanic?

### This notebook goes through a basic exploratory data analysis of the Kaggle Titanic dataset with Python

Although this notebook works towards creating a Kaggle submission, it should not be taken as exhaustive list of things to do with a dataset. It has been setup as an introduction to get you started with exploratory data analysis (EDA).

There are challenges and extensions listed throughout. I encourage you to take the foundations here and build upon them.

If you complete the challenges or get a better score than the one listed at the bottom of this notebook, please let me know at https://www.linkedin.com/in/shokatsaifi/

Keep learning,
